Project 4


This project simulates address translation (i.e. virtual addresses to physical addresses).
It accomplishes this through the use of a page table and TLB.

For each entry in addresses.txt, it first checks to see if the page is in the TLB.
If it isn't, it then looks through the page table. If the entry still isn't found, 
it will load the page from BACKING_STORE.bin, treating it like RAM.

The TLB can hold 16 entries, and the page table can hold 256. each entry has a 256
byte page containing the actual data from the backing store that gets directly read 
when a TLB/page hit occurs.



LIMITATIONS
----------------------------
- Only designed for a maximum of 1000 entries
- The backing store must be named "BACKING_STORE.bin" and it must be in the same directory as the executable.
